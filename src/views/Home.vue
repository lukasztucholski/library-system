    <h1>Library System</h1>
    <p>It's not done yet. It's very early alpha version.</p>
    <p>The code is changed very often. It's draft version so it will be improved soon.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Used technology:</p>
    <p>JavScript Framework - Vue.js with Vue Router.</p>
    <p>Soon also Vuex for state managment. For now, I used Event Bus for some data.</p>
    <p>Firebase - for Database and Auth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Main focus at components comunication, app structure, functionality, working with firebase.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Actually pre-working: Catalog, Cart, Borrowing books, User/Admin Menu/Panel in preview option, Sign Up / In Forms.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Soon it will be has better CSS styling. With RWD of course. I'm still wondering what to get use. Bootstrap or pure CSS (Flexbox or GRID).</p>
