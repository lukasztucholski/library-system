Library System with Admin & User Panels
<br />
<br />

It's not done yet. It's very early alpha version.

The code is changed very often. It's draft version so it will be improved soon.
<br />
<br />

Live Demo: http://lukasztucholski.pl/library/
<br />
<br />

Used technology:

JavScript Framework - Vue.js with Vue Router.

Soon also Vuex for state managment. For now, I used Event Bus for some data.

Firebase - for Database and Auth.
<br />
<br />

Actually pre-working: Catalog, Cart, Borrowing books, User/Admin Menu/Panel in preview option, Sign Up / In Forms.

Main focus at components comunication, app structure, functionality, working with firebase.

Soon it will be has better CSS styling. With RWD of course.
